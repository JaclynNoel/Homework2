*Having Trouble putting in photo* \^\^

Every Saturday morning, at the same time, a primatologist goes and sits in the forest to listen for titi monkey calls, counting the number of calls they hear in a 2 hour window from 5am to 7am. Based on previous knowledge, she believes that the mean number of calls she will hear in that time is exactly 15. Let X represent the appropriate Poisson random variable of the number of calls heard in each monitoring session.

## What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?

p(x\>8)=1-p(x≤8)

ppois(x,y)- calculates probability up to x

```{r}
probability <- 1 -ppois(8, 15)
probability

```

## What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?

dpois(x,y)- calculates probability for that exact number

```{r}
prob0<- dpois(0,15)
prob0
```

## What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?

```{r}
prob3<- dpois(3,15)
prob3
```

## Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30.

```{r}
x_values <- 0:30
poisson_probs <- dpois(x_values, lambda = 15)
plot(x_values, poisson_probs, type = "h", lwd = 2, col = "blue",
     main = "Poisson(15) Probability Mass Function",
     xlab = "Number of Calls", ylab = "Probability")

points(x_values, poisson_probs, pch = 16, col = "red")

```

## Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).

```{r}
simulated_calls <- rpois(104, lambda = 15)
hist(simulated_calls, breaks = 10, col = "lightblue", border = "black",
     main = "Histogram of Simulated Titi Monkey Calls",
     xlab = "Number of Calls", ylab = "Frequency")

```

## Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?

```{r}
hist(simulated_calls, breaks = 10, col = "lightblue", border = "black",
     main = "Histogram of Simulated Titi Monkey Calls",
     xlab = "Number of Calls", ylab = "Frequency", xlim = c(0, 30))

```

### Challenges

-   Putting in a picture

-   I've been having trouble with packages wanting to constantly update, I have no idea why

-   Making sure I'm using the correct probability equation

-   
#Comments: the document is well structured and easy to follow. There was also a great use of theoretical probability calculations and simulations. 
#Some explantions of probability functions can be slightly expanded or refined for clarity. 
#The probability equations were used correctly!
